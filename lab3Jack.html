His fans and the other members call him “Big Kat.” He’s the sanest and most normal in the group, for the others are just wild. In early times of his career, he worked in restaurant as waiter for short duration of time for collection of experience. He is now in a happy relationship with his French girlfriend, Helena Cassilly. </p>
