		<p> <font size="5" face="courier" color="black"> Cole Whittle, bassist. According to him, he’s an alien, a funk robot, a fashion nemesis, and a party animal. He is the only one in the band who didn’t have past interactions with the other members. He claims to have been sent from Mars. The first band he ever performed with was called Fish Nipple. He trained in classical piano beginning at the age of six before trying out jazz and avant-garde. Cole is one guy with the coolest concepts and tattoos. He is very iconic and rad, especially with his hairstyle. </p>
